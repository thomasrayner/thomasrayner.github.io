Registration for the <a href="http://powershellsummit.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit</a> just opened today. This thing sells out every year so now is the time to start getting approval to attend if you need it, and buy a ticket.

Check out the <a href="https://cdn-powershell.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018-Brochure.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">event brochure</a> for info about the conference. You can use it as leverage to convince whoever needs convincing that you should go. The <a href="https://powershelldevopsglobalsummit2018.sched.com/grid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit speaker line up and session schedule</a> is also up right now, and as you'll see, it's absolutely stacked. This is also a great chance to meet people who work at Microsoft on the PowerShell (and other) teams, as well as a bunch of MVPs at the top of this field. Make no mistake, this is a crazy good networking opportunity.

There are limited hotel discount codes available, and plane tickets will probably only rise in price as you wait, so get on it if you're going to come!

Some of the sessions I'm most excited for are Kirk Munro's <a href="https://powershelldevopsglobalsummit2018.sched.com/event/CnMh/become-a-powershell-debugging-ninja" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Become a PowerShell Debugging Ninja</a>, Warren Frame's C<a href="https://powershelldevopsglobalsummit2018.sched.com/event/Cpp3/connecting-the-dots-with-powershell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">onnecting the Dots with PowerShell</a>, Eli Hess' <a href="https://powershelldevopsglobalsummit2018.sched.com/event/Cpp8/powershell-iot-what-net-core-has-done-for-your-raspberry-pi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerShell IoT</a>, Ryan Coates <a href="https://powershelldevopsglobalsummit2018.sched.com/event/Cqc3/the-build-release-pipeline-model-for-mere-mortals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Build Release Pipeline Model For Mere Mortals</a>, Will Anderson's <a href="https://powershelldevopsglobalsummit2018.sched.com/event/Cqc8/automate-problem-solving-with-powershell-azure-automation-and-oms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automate Problem Solving with PowerShell, Azure Automation and OMS</a>, and of course the session that I'm presenting, <a href="https://powershelldevopsglobalsummit2018.sched.com/event/Cqi6/a-crash-course-in-writing-your-own-psscriptanalyzer-rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Crash Course in Writing Your Own PSScriptAnalyzer Rules</a>.

It's going to be really hard to go to a "bad" session, though. With this line up, it's going to be impossible not to learn something valuable no matter which sessions you attend.

Hope to see you there!
