Are you going to be at Techmentor Redmond next week? I will be! You can catch me at my workshop on Monday and learn some Master Powershell tricks, or at my session on Tuesday to learn to write code that doesn't suck. I'll also be hanging around the rest of the conference, dinner events, and other people's sessions.



I'd love to meet you! Say hi and I'll give you a sticker (while supplies last).
