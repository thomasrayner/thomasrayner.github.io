I'm very excited to share that my newest Pluralsight course was published over the weekend: <a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1209528/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fazure-automation-diving-deeper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure Automation: Diving Deeper</a>. This builds on my first course, <a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1209528/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fazure-automation-getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getting Started with Azure Automation</a>.

Pluralsight is a paid service but trials are available, and it's a benefit of having an MSDN subscription. They've got thousands of hours of good stuff for people working in all areas of technology, including my new course.

My <a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1209528/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fazure-automation-diving-deeper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure Automation: Diving Deeper course</a> will teach you everything you need to know to put Azure Automation on your resume, market yourself as an IT Automation pro, and increase your worth as a professional. Please check it out and don't hesitate to contact me with any questions or feedback.

As a Pluralsight author, I am compensated for creating courses, so this is technically a sponsored post. I do, however, truly believe in their service, and think that many people who read my blog may benefit from watching my courses.
