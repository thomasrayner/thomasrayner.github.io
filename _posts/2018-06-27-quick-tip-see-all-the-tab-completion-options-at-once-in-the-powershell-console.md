If you're used to working in VS Code or the PowerShell ISE, you've undoubtedly enjoyed intellisense which is the feature that shows you all the tab completion options at once. That functionality is really handy, but what if you're in the PowerShell console? The little overlayed windows don't pop up there with your completion options. You can still tab through until you find what you want, but it's not the same.

Don't worry, there's a PSReadline feature that will save you here.

Start typing something, like a cmdlet, and then instead of tab completing it, useÂ <strong>Ctrl + Space</strong> to see the different options available to you. You can navigate through the different options using the arrow keys. Check out this gif of this feature in action.

Super handy. I love this feature for hunting through different parameters for a cmdlet.
