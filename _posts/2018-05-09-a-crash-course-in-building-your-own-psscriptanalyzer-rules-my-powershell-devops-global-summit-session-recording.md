I had the pleasure of presenting a session at the PowerShell and DevOps Global Summit in Bellevue in April 2018 and the session recordings went live last week. My session was titled A Crash Course in Building Your Own PSScriptAnalyzer Rules and it's a pretty fast 45 minutes. I've been getting lots of wonderful feedback on it, so if this is something you might be into, please give the recording a watch! It's easier than you might think.
