I try my best to make new technical posts on this blog every Wednesday morning. They vary in length, skill level, and sometimes even usefulness. Today I wanted to share that my first Pluralsight course was published last week: <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/azure-automation-getting-started">Getting Started with Azure Automation</a>.

&nbsp;

Pluralsight is a paid service but trials are available, and it's a benefit of having an MSDN subscription. They've got thousands of hours of good stuff for people working in all areas of technology, including my new course.

&nbsp;

My <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/azure-automation-getting-started">Getting Started with Azure Automation course</a> will take you from zero knowledge to functionally useful in just over an hour. Please check it out and don't hesitate to contact me with any questions or feedback.

As a Pluralsight author, I am compensated for creating courses so this is technically a sponsored post. I do, however, truly believe in their service overall, and think many people who read my blog may benefit from watching my course.
