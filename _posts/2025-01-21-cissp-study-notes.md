A little while ago, I spent about a month studying for and getting my Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certification from ISC2. I went about studying for the test a few ways:

* I used the PocketPrep app
* I attended a study bootcamp
* I did a bunch of practice tests

And finally...

* I got the ISC2 CISSP official study guide - I read it cover to cover, and highlighted and annotated the entire thing.

[Twitter (@MrThomasRayner)](https://twitter.com/mrthomasrayner) told me there is interest in seeing my study notes. So, here we go! Welcome to my 21 part series on the takeaways and crucial points from each chapter in the ISC2 CISSP official study guide. To be clear, this isn't a replacement for all those other study methods I mentioned above. This is just a supplement. This also isn't *everything* you need to know for the test. This is just what I feel are the most important points.

The CISSP exam is often said to be "a mile wide but only an inch deep" which means you need to know a little bit about **a lot of stuff**. Accordingly, these posts contain **a lot of points** and while you might not be questioned on all of them, you could be questioned on any of them. It's important to have a good grip on *every chapter* in its entirety.
