If you're active on social media and follow things about PowerShell, you've probably already seen some information about <a href="https://leanpub.com/powershell-conference-book" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the PowerShell Conference Book</a>. It's a community effort that was created to support the <a href="https://powershell.org/summit/summit-onramp/onramp-scholarship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerShell.org OnRamp Scholarship Program</a>.

I had the distinct honor of being asked to participate in this book, which has chapters from dozens of the brightest minds in the PowerShell community. My chapter is about creating custom PSScriptAnalyzer rules.

If you follow my work at all, you might realize that sounds familiar. Isn't that the session that I did at PowerShell and DevOps Global Summit 2018? Well yes it is. The point of this book is to basically be a print-format conference. Obviously the networking and socializing part is a little bit lacking (it's a book, give us a break) but the "attend different talks and learn about a crazy variety of awesome topics" part is more than well covered. Every chapter is written by a subject matter expert, independent of the other chapters - kind of like how talks at a conference are given.

If you've never been to the PowerShell and DevOps Global Summit or the European or Asian equivalent conferences, then you'll get a bit of a glimpse of the world class content and knowledge that gets shared at these things. Either way, all of the proceeds from your purchase of this book goes directly towards funding the OnRamp Scholarship Program which is a full-ride to the next PowerShell and DevOps Global Summit for people who are underrepresented in IT, and people who are just getting started in their careers and could use a boost. It's going to make a real difference in some people's lives, and is incredibly worthwhile.

Basically what I'm trying to say is this: buy the book. You're virtually guaranteed to learn something that will have this book paying for itself real fast. Plus, you're supporting an awesome cause.
