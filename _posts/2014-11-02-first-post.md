Everybody knows that the first post on a blog isn't supposed to have any real content or be super helpful. Let's just get it out of the way, then.

You may be interested to know about a couple articles I wrote for <a title="SysJAM" href="http://sysjam.wordpress.com" target="_blank">SysJAM</a>Â that would fit in well here:

<ol>
    <li><a title="Who's Got Access?" href="http://sysjam.wordpress.com/2014/10/03/whos-got-access-to-this-directory/" target="_blank">Using PowerShell to find out who has access to a directory</a></li>
    <li><a title="Calling SCORCH RB from SMA" href="http://sysjam.wordpress.com/2014/09/15/sma-scheduled-runbook-that-calls-a-system-center-orchestrator-scorch-runbook-fails/" target="_blank">Troubleshooting an issue with calling a SCORCH runbook from SMA</a></li>
</ol>

I guess I could also plug the <a title="About &amp; Contact" href="http://www.workingsysadmin.com/about/">About/Contact page</a> in case you somehow missed the big link at the top of every page.
