Hi, my name is Thomas and I'm a technologist. I think that means that I'm not an IT Pro, not a Dev, but someone who works with all kinds of technologies without worrying about the title. When I started this blog, though, I was a systems administrator and that's where the name Working Sysadmin comes from.

I like blogging about stuff I figure out or use at work. I've positioned this blog as learnings and tales from a real person and so some posts might not be perfect solutions, especially considering that your environment is probably different from mine. The content posted on this site might be a result from things I've done at my job but all content, thoughts and opinions on this website are my own and are not necessarily shared by my employer. I maintain this blog on my own time.

There are a couple goals for this blog: 1. Have a place for me to put complex stuff I've figured out so I (and others) can refer to it later, 2. Make a resource of tips that might help other people.

Other than commenting on the posts on this blog, there are a few different ways to contact me. I'm available by email at <a title="Email Me" href="mailto:ThmsRynr@outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ThmsRynr@outlook.com</a>, on Twitter at <a title="@ThmsRynr on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/MrThomasRayner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@MrThomasRayner</a>, and on LinkedIn at <a title="Connect on LinkedIn" href="http://ca.linkedin.com/in/thomasrayner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://ca.linkedin.com/in/thomasrayner/</a>. Please reach out to me on any or all of these platforms. I love getting feedback on my posts, hearing about how they work for you (or don't), ideas you have, or posts you'd like to see me write about. I'm also open to putting up guest articles in some situations.

Since April, 2015, I'm proud to be a <a title="Thomas Rayner's Microsoft MVP Page" href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/Thomas%20Rayner-5001315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft MVP</a>. (Update: As of July 2018, after four MVP awards, I'm no longer eligible for the MVP program since I now work at Microsoft!)
